# Semantic search with Hugging Face models and Vector DB (Singlestore) 
The semantic search is unlike traditional keyword-based search methods. Semantic search algorithms take into account the relationships b/w words and their meanings. It enables semantic search to deliver more accurate results- even when search terms are vague or ambigious.    

#SingleStore DB
